 ⚠️ Important: Model File

The AI model file (`.onnx`) is not included in this repository due to size limitations.

To use the project locally:
1. Download the deepfake detection model file.
2. Create a folder named `models` in the project root.
3. Place the `.onnx` file inside that folder (for example: `deepfake_light.onnx`).
